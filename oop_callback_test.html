<!-----

A small code sample in which an object initiates a setTimeout calling a function of the object itself. It uses the special 'this' keyword and explains the 'self' temp var workaround.

This should also work for other timeout callbacks like AJAX callbacks.

More about the 'this' keyword and javascript scopes: http://howtonode.org/what-is-this

Tested in Chrome.
